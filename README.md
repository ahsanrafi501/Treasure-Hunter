Code Structure

The main entry point for the game is the Main class located in the Main package. Below is the Main class code:

package Main;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame window = new JFrame();
        window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        window.setResizable(false);
        window.setTitle("2D Adventure");
        
        GamePanel gamePanel = new GamePanel();
        window.add(gamePanel);
        
        window.pack();
        
        window.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        window.setVisible(true);

        gamePanel.setupGame();
